"""Chi2 losses and the robustness annealing schedule.

The loss layer: each class holds a DataVectorGeometry (composition, not
inheritance) and adds the chi2 (the masked Mahalanobis distance
r^T Cinv r per sample) and the training loss on it. CosmolikeChi2 is the
plain loss (trimming, a focal hardness weight, a sqrt / pseudo-Huber
transform). RescaledChi2 and ResidualBaseChi2 are the two analytic-R
variants (R divides the net output, versus R moves only the baseline).
ElementWeightedChi2 up-weights the worst-fit dv elements. anneal_value is
the per-epoch trim / focus schedule; make_chi2 builds the right loss from
a geometry and a rescale mode.

PS: the Mahalanobis distance r^T Cinv r is a squared residual r weighted
by the inverse covariance Cinv (this is the chi2); "masked" means only
the unmasked data-vector entries the analysis keeps enter the sum.

  Build the chi2fn (loss + geometry wrapper), optionally rescaled.

  The analytic rescaling divides out a fast linear reference R
  (E&H zero-baryon, single-plane Limber) so the network emulates a
  flatter target; the chi2 is always reported on the original
  physical dv. The two variants share R and differ only in where R
  enters d_pred, hence whether R lands in the loss gradient (full
  derivation in the class docstrings):

    rescale = "none"     -> plain CosmolikeChi2 (no R).
              "rescaled" -> RescaledChi2 (v1, "A" form): R divides
                            the net output, so the chi2 gradient
                            carries a per-cosmology diag(1/R)
                            conditioning factor.
              "residual" -> ResidualBaseChi2 (v2, "B" form): R
                            moves only the baseline; the net enters
                            at unit gain and the chi2 is plain
                            (no /R) -- clean prior isolation.

  Both variants need the per-element angle/tomography map on the
  geometry (build_shear_angle_map, imported lazily so a plain build
  does not pull in the cosmolike-importing geometry module) and the
  analytic config (configure_rescaling).

  Arguments:
    geom           = DataVectorGeometry for the probe (e.g. xi).
    rescale        = "none" / "rescaled" / "residual" (see above).
    param_geometry = ParamGeometry whose decode maps the whitened
                     model inputs back to physical params (what R
                     reads); required when rescale != "none".
    cosmo_mid      = (n_param,) reference cosmology where R = 1,
                     typically the training-cloud mean; required
                     when rescale != "none".
    data_dir       = cosmolike data folder for the angle map.
    dataset        = .dataset ini for the angle map.
    include_amp    = pass the (Om h^2)^ns/h amplitude factor to the
                     analytic R (standard run: True).

  Returns:
    a CosmolikeChi2 (or RescaledChi2 / ResidualBaseChi2) to pass to
    run_emulator as chi2fn.
