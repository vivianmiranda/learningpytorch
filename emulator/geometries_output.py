"""Output (data-vector) geometries and the shear angle map.

This module is the output side: it owns every transform between a raw
cosmolike data vector and the whitened, masked target the network
predicts, plus the chi2's covariance. DataVectorGeometry is the base (it
squeezes to the unmasked entries, centers, whitens in the covariance
eigenbasis, and inverts each step). DiagonalGeometry whitens by the
marginal sigma only (theta order kept, for a 1D-CNN head), and
BlockDiagonalGeometry whitens each tomographic bin by its own sub-block.
build_shear_angle_map attaches the per-element angle / tomography metadata
(theta, source redshifts, xi+/- branch, per-bin sizes). This is the only
module that imports cosmolike.

PS: to whiten is to rotate into the covariance eigenbasis and scale to
unit variance (decorrelated, equally-hard-to-fit components). To squeeze
is to keep only the unmasked entries of the full data vector (the masked
ones are what the analysis drops). encode = squeeze, center, then whiten,
the form the network predicts.

  Geometry and normalization of one probe's masked data
  vector.

  To "whiten" is to rotate into the covariance eigenbasis
  and scale each direction to unit variance, so correlated
  quantities become decorrelated and equally scaled. Here
  it is applied to the data-vector targets, so every network
  output is decorrelated and equally hard to fit.

  One instance owns every transform between a raw cosmolike
  data vector and the vector the network sees, for a single
  probe (xi, gammat, wtheta, or the full 3x2pt). It holds:

    - dest_idx: positions, in the full 3x2pt vector, of the
      entries that survive the mask. squeeze picks these
      columns out of the data vector; unsqueeze scatters
      them back into a full-length zero vector.
    - evecs / sqrt_ev: the whitening basis (evecs is the
      rotation, sqrt_ev the per-direction scale).
    - Cinv: the full-3x2pt masked inverse covariance the
      chi2 contracts against.
    - center: the training-mean of the kept entries (the
      targets' zero-point; cancels in a residual chi2).

  Build it from cosmolike at training time (from_cosmolike)
  or from saved tensors at inference time (from_state); the
  geometry travels with the weights, so inference never
  rereads cosmolike.

  dtype sets the precision of the whitening basis and Cinv.
  float32 (default) gives fast GEMMs -- on this xi covariance
  the float64-vs-float32 chi2 gap is ~1e-7, while float64
  runs ~1/64 speed on a consumer GPU. Use float64 for
  cross-correlated 3x2pt if the stiff directions need it.
  The eigendecomposition is always done in float64 (numpy,
  at construction); only the stored result is cast to dtype.

  Attach the cosmic-shear angle/tomography map to a geometry.

  Per kept (unmasked) element: its angular scale theta, the two
  source redshifts of its tomographic pair, and its xi+/- branch
  (pm_kept: 0 = xi_plus, 1 = xi_minus). Also stores the
  block-level metadata the matrix-layout plotting needs
  (theta_centers, z_src, ntheta, source_ntomo, xi_size) and the
  per-bin kept-element counts bin_sizes (bin = (xi+/-, source
  pair); contiguous in dest_idx order, summing to n_keep) that a
  per-bin BlockDiagonalGeometry / ParallelResMLP split on. Reads
  the dataset ini and the source n(z) file only -- no cosmolike.

  Assumes xi ordering xi_plus then xi_minus, each looping source
  pairs (i<=j) outer and theta inner. Verify against your
  cosmolike layout; reorder below if not.

  Arguments:
    geom     = DataVectorGeometry (or subclass) for probe "xi";
               geom.dest_idx gives the kept within-block
               positions.
