"""Device selection, construction factories, evaluation, and training.

This module is the run layer that ties the package together. pick_device
and make_logger are setup helpers. make_model, make_optimizer, and
make_scheduler each build one component from a {cls, **kwargs} spec dict,
and build_run_specs assembles the six spec dicts from a config (with the
default / suggest / search resolvers for the [default, min, max, kind]
hyperparameter ranges). eval_val and eval_source_chi2 score the model,
training_loop_batched is the per-epoch loop (trim / focus annealing and
best-epoch tracking), and run_emulator is the top-level orchestrator that
builds everything, then trains, returning the model and the per-epoch
histories.
