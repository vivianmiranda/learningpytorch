"""N_train learning curve: f(delta-chi2 > thr) vs N_train for one config."""

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Example how to run this program
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Sweeps the training-set size for one fixed config, recording validation
# f(delta-chi2 > threshold) at each size -- the learning curve telling whether
# the floor is data-limited (still falling at the largest N) or capacity /
# architecture-limited (a flat tail).
#
#     python driver/sweep_ntrain_emulator_cosmic_shear.py \
#       --yaml driver/train_single_emulator_cosmic_shear.yaml \
#       --n-min 2000 --n-points 6 --out ntrain_resmlp
#
#- Reuses the training driver's YAML (and its model/rescale/activation choices).
#  To compare architectures or chi2 modes, run once per config (vary
#  train_args.model.name or --rescale / --activation, with a different --out),
#  then overlay the saved <out>.txt curves.
#
#- Per N_train (geometric grid [--n-min .. --n-max], --n-max defaults to the
#  full physically-cut pool), stages a nested subset of that size, rebuilds the
#  geometry from it, trains a fresh model silently, and scores
#  f(delta-chi2 > --threshold) on the fixed validation set.
#
#- Multiple GPUs (one node): grid points are independent trainings, so they run
#  in parallel, one process per GPU, split by the Longest-Processing-Time rule
#  (largest N_train first to the least-loaded GPU) so each GPU gets about the
#  same total N_train and they finish together. On an 8-GPU node, add
#  `--n-points 12 --n-gpus 8` to the call above.
#
#  One GPU (or none, e.g. the Apple-MPS dev machine) falls back to a serial
#  loop, so the same script runs everywhere.
#
#- `--yaml` (required): config (data + train_args), training-driver schema;
#  train_args.model.name picks ResMLP / ResCNN.
#- `--rescale` / `--activation`: as in the training driver, fixed across the
#  sweep (analytic-R mode and ResBlock activation).
#- `--n-gpus` (default: all visible CUDA devices): GPUs to spread across. 1, or
#  no CUDA, is serial.
#- `--n-min` (default 2000), `--n-max` (default = pool), `--n-points` (default
#  5): geometric N_train grid (clamped to the pool, deduplicated).
#- `--threshold` (default 0.2): delta-chi2 cutoff the fraction counts.
#- `--out` (default ntrain_sweep): writes <out>.txt (curve + config,
#  np.loadtxt-loadable) and <out>.pdf (single-curve figure).
#- `--quiet`: suppress stdout (txt and pdf still written).
#
#- Trains one full model per grid point (--n-points trainings, divided across
#  the GPUs) -- run it on the workstation, where cosmolike lives.
