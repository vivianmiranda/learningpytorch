"""Activation bake-off: f(delta-chi2 > thr) vs N_train, one curve per act."""

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Example how to run this program
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bakes off the ResBlock activation head-to-head: per activation, measures
# validation f(delta-chi2 > threshold) over a grid of training-set sizes,
# overlaying the curves. A double loop (N_train x activation) whose verdict is
# the curve shape: a real inductive-bias win keeps descending (lower sample
# complexity) where others flatten, not a single-N offset.
#
#     python driver/bakeoff_activation_emulator_cosmic_shear.py \
#       --yaml driver/train_single_emulator_cosmic_shear.yaml \
#       --n-min 2000 --n-points 6 --out bakeoff_act
#
#- Per N_train (geometric grid [--n-min .. --n-max], --n-max defaults to the
#  full physically-cut pool), stages a nested subset and builds the geometry
#  once, then silently trains a fresh model per activation and scores
#  f(delta-chi2 > --threshold) on the fixed validation set. Data and geometry
#  are activation-independent: shared at that N; only the model rebuilds.
#
#- Multiple GPUs (one node): activations split across GPUs, one process per GPU,
#  each running the whole grid for its share. Activations cost about the same
#  and every GPU runs the full grid: equal work, no cost-aware balancing (unlike
#  the N_train sweep). At most len(activations) GPUs used; default 4
#  activations, 8 GPUs, 4 idle. With --n-gpus 4:
#
#     python driver/bakeoff_activation_emulator_cosmic_shear.py \
#       --yaml driver/train_single_emulator_cosmic_shear.yaml \
#       --n-points 8 --n-gpus 4 --out bakeoff_act
#
#  One GPU (or none, e.g. the Apple-MPS dev machine) runs the serial double
#  loop, so one script runs everywhere.
#
#- Reuses the training driver's YAML (data, model = ResMLP / ResCNN via
#  train_args.model.name, rest of train_args). The YAML activation and usual
#  --activation flag are ignored; this driver sweeps it.
#
#- `--yaml` (required): config (data + train_args), training-driver schema.
#- `--activations` (default H,power,multigate,gated_power): comma-separated
#  subset to bake off.
#- `--rescale`: analytic-R mode, fixed across the bake-off (as in training).
#- `--n-gpus` (default: all visible CUDA devices, capped at len(activations)):
#  GPUs to split activations across. 1, or no CUDA, is serial.
#- `--n-min` (default 2000), `--n-max` (default = pool), `--n-points` (default
#  5): geometric N_train grid (clamped to the pool, deduplicated).
#- `--threshold` (default 0.2): delta-chi2 cutoff the fraction counts.
#- `--out` (default bakeoff_act): writes <out>.txt (every curve + config,
#  np.loadtxt-loadable, one column per activation) and <out>.pdf (figure).
#- `--quiet`: suppress stdout (txt and pdf still written).
#
#- One full model per (N_train, activation): len(grid) x len(activations)
#  trainings long -- run it on the workstation.
